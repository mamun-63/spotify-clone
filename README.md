#### Description

- It's a massive build to learn API fetching I can say.

- Spotify API has it's own User Authentication. But it has no permission to use like user-password login system. You need prior spotify account attached to the browser, only then you can access to spotify main page. I have used my own spotify account id to get real time Playlist and songs to display in this clone. So if you are trying this app, you can't go to with that login.

- You can't play song, play next, control sound or use shuffle in this clone. This can be done only if you have premium spotify developer account maybe.
